Introduction and Scope\n**Found:** General privacy commitment but no specific reference to DPDP Act 2023.  \n**Relevant Section:** [Section 4 - Applicability](https://datainfa.com/dpdp-act/)  \n**Compliance Status:** Partial - Needs explicit reference to Indian law  \n**Recommendation:** Add specific statement about DPDP Act compliance for Indian users.\n\n### 2.
